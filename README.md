### Hi there! My name is Josh.

My name is Josh. I am an engineer at [Nudge](https://nudge.com), a brain-computer interface company founded by the original CTO of Coinbase, where I work on infrastructure, security, simulations, and full-stack data collection tools. Before that, I spent a few years as an early employee and contractor at multiple startups; I also built AI infrastructure for Adobe's document intelligence team while researching programming languages.

Here are a few open source projects of which I am especially proud:

- In collaboration with Adobe research, [I used React, TypeScript, and Ruby on Rails to build Atlas](https://github.com/frictionlessweb/documentstudies), a tool that lets NLP researchers generate data annotation surveys by uploading JSON files and PDF documents.
- I fixed [over 100 bugs in DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/graphs/contributors) after I created automatic bug-detection tools that helped me find mismatches between TypeScript type declarations and JavaScript code. Those tools are open-source, and you can [view them here.](https://github.com/joshuaharry/jscontract)
- I've implemented [a simplified clone of React](https://github.com/joshuaharry/featherweight-react) used to help explain the rules of hooks to Professors at Northwestern University who are interested in the semantics of the framework.
- I've written [a library for managing dotfiles with Emacs](https://github.com/joshuaharry/homer) and [a library for automatically formatting code with Emacs](https://github.com/joshuaharry/efmt).

If any of my work sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day.
