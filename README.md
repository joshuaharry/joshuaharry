### Hi there! My name is Josh.

I'm a software engineer with experience working with programming languages, web development, and AI. I currently work closely with Adobe's Document Intelligence Lab on building the next generation of AI-powered document readers.

Here are a few open source projects of which I am especially proud:

- I am the [39th contributor on DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/graphs/contributors), as I created automatic bug-detection tools that helped me find mismatches between TypeScript type declarations and JavaScript code. Those tools are open-source, and you can [view them here.](https://github.com/joshuaharry/jscontract)
- I've implemented [a simplified clone of React](https://github.com/joshuaharry/featherweight-react) used to help explain the rules of hooks to Professors at Northwestern University who are interested in the semantics of the framework.
- I've written [a library for managing dotfiles with Emacs](https://github.com/joshuaharry/homer) and [a library for automatically formatting code with Emacs](https://github.com/joshuaharry/efmt).

If any of my work sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day.
